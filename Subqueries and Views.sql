#Create a database named Product and create a table called Customer with the following fields in the Product database: Customer_Id - Make PRIMARY KEY First_name Last_name Email Phone_no Address City State Zip_code Country 

#1. Create a view named customer_info for the Customer table that displays Customerâ€™s Full name and email address. Then perform the SELECT operation for the customer_info view. 
#2. Create a view named US_Customers that displays customers located in the US. 
#3. Create another view named Customer_details with columns full name(Combine first_name and last_name), email, phone_no, and state. 
#4. Update phone numbers of customers who live in California for Customer_details view. 
#5. Count the number of customers in each state and show only states with more than 5 customers. 
#6. Write a query that will return the number of customers in each state, based on the "state" column in the "customer_details" view. 
#7. Write a query that returns all the columns from the "customer_details" view, sorted by the "state" column in ascending order.
